Ingenium project for scanning and 3D visualization with the Velodyne VLP-32c LiDAR sensor.

## Data Capture
The plan is to use a Raspberry Pi for recording data via Ethernet.

## Mapping and Visualization
The plan is to map and do 3D reconstruction of excavation sites that can change in time, either with GPS or SLAM algorithms.
