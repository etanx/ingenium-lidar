## VeloDyne VLP-32c LiDAR Mapping by Ingenium

Ingenium project for scanning and 3D visualization with the Velodyne VLP-32c LiDAR "Ultra-Puck" sensor. Ingenium's goal is to use a Raspberry Pi 3 for recording data via Ethernet, then 3D-reconstruct excavation sites with SLAM algorithm's mapping.

# Raspberry Pi 3 Setup 
Install git on your device and clone this repository:
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
git clone https://github.com/etanx/ingenium-lidar.git
```
To navigate to the folder in terminal, change directory with:
```
cd /home/pi/ingenium-lidar
```
# Data Capture
See folder 'Python' for simple data capture.

# Mapping and Visualization
Work in progress.
